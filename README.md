# Real Time Face Detection With JavaScript

I have setted up real time face detection through a webcam using AI. This AI is so quick that we are able to draw in real time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video without much performance overhead. I have used the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow to setup the face detection.
